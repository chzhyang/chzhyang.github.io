Today, I got a deep dive into open-sora from top AI infra expert Yang You. His insights were spot on, especially on low-cost training strategies—definitely worth checking out.

> Professor You Yang is from the Computer Science Department at National University of Singapore(NUS) and is also the founder of [Luchentech](https://www.luchentech.com/#colossal-ai). He earned his PhD from UC Berkeley under James Demmel. Luchentech has a well-known AI infra framework: [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI), which introduced the 3D TP concept.

We also discussed the business models for AI infra and came away with a few key takeaways:

- Once LLM structures converge, the room for inference optimization is nearly maxed out. The top foundational model companies are likely to dominate cloud-based inference, making it tough for pure inference AI infra to profit solely through APIs
- Video generation haven't yet found the best scaling law path and still have room for improvement
