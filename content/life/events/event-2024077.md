Today, I attended a LLM tech talk by Tianle Cai at MiraclePlus(Beijing).

The key topics discussed include #Medusa, #System co-design, #AI-infra business models, #Fast and Slow Thinking, and #Multimodal Performance Optimization. What stood out the most was the discussion on how LLM tackle math problems, and the relationship between mathematical expression and difficulty, along with the system modes of fast and slow thinking.

Tianle Cai’s imagination is incredibly rich—definitely worth the trip!
